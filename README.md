## 🦠 What's "Pesnuk"? 

![Penyakit fesbuk gila](https://i.imgur.com/4dDDMpz.jpeg)

The name comes from Indonesian Facebook meme culture:
- **"Fesbuk"** → Common local spelling of Facebook  
- **"Fesnuk"** → Intentional typo used in memes  
- **"Penyakit Fesnuk Gila"** (Crazy Fesnuk Disease) → Viral term describing Facebook addiction  

Pesnuk is your antidote to this "disease" - a tool to use Facebook intentionally, not compulsively.

## 🎯 Why Pesnuk Exists

*"I just want to check notifications, but end up scrolling for hours!"*  

**Replace your default Facebook app icon with Pesnuk to:**
- 🛑 **Block autopilot opens** - No more feed-first design  
- 🔔 **See notifications only** on launch  
- 🃏 **Browse posts consciously** with card-style view + daily limits  
- ✍️ **Draft posts mindfully** without immediate publishing (keeping your account productive 🤭)

## ✨ Planned Features (Minimalist Vision)

### Core Philosophy  
*"A speed bump between you and Facebook's dopamine hits"*

| Feature                | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Notifications Gate** | Must-click-through screen showing only new notifications (maybe we could force exit the app when there's no notifications 😕? That means you have to be interactive with your friendlist to continue using Facebook lol)                    |
| **Card View**          | Posts appear as cards (configurable daily limit). No more endless scrolling             |
| **Post Ideas**         | Local drafts that redirect to Facebook.com when ready to post. Keeping your profile productive (not just sharing posts)               |
| **One-Tap Exit**       | Prominent "Done" button that closes app after checking essentials (maybe not important)           |

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety

**Why trust Pesnuk?**
- 🕵️ **Full transparency** - Open source code; no hidden trackers  
- 📱 **Zero data collection** - Everything stays on your device  
- 🔐 **Minimal permissions** - Only needs internet access (to load Facebook)    

*"If you don't trust us, build it yourself!"* ← We mean this literally.

## 🛠 Roadmap (Research Phase)

### Phase 0: Technical Research (Current Stage)
- ✅ **WebView strategy**: Confirming Facebook mobile site works in `react-native-webview`...  
- ✅ **DOM scraping tests**: Can it extract notifications via CSS selectors? 
- 🔄 **Cookie experiments**: Testing session persistence across app restarts...  
- ⏳ **UI prototypes**: Just pray because I'm not a front-end programmer 💀    

### Future Ideas (Post-Stable)  
- *goes here*

## 🌱 How to Contribute

**We welcome:**  
- React Native developers familiar with WebView hacking  
- UI designers for user interfaces  
- Beta testers willing to replace their Facebook app icon  

**Getting started:**
